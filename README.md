<summary>Step</summary>
The whole project include the following steps

- Descriptive analysis.

- Predictive analysis: 

  (1) Using K-means to identify geological clusters based on latitude and longitude to lower dimension. 

  (2) Selecting features based on random forest.

  (3) Using LASSO, XgBoost, Random Forest and DNN to predict different type of Soybean Yield and find out the best model on test set according to its determining factors like temperature, moisture, radiation, etc. 

- Prescriptive:

  Since the weather condition is not confirmed in future years, corresponding determining factors including temperature, moisture and radiation is not determined. Actually, their distribution can be estimated base weather condition history. Based on different weather condition, different type of Soybeans will have different yield.

  With this, to find out the best combination of Soybean to generate maximum yield, **Markowitz** capital optimization is used.
